*Refer to the provided table for detailed morphological characteristics of different sugarcane varieties.*

*   **Crop Management**
    *   **Tillage:** Deep ploughing, harrowing two or three times, forming ridges and furrows at 90 cm apart. In wetlands, prepare the land to a fine tilth and plant the setts at a spacing of 90 cm.
    *   **Spacing:** 90 cm is optimum. For the late planting season (April – May), wider row spacing of 120 cm is recommended.
    *   **Seed Rate:** Three budded setts @ 75,000 / ha.
    *   **Preparation of Setts:** Select healthy setts from 8-10 months old crop, soak the setts in lime water (1 kg in 100 litres of water) overnight and dip the setts in 0.1% Carbendazim solution for 15 minutes.
    *   **Sett Treatment:** Treat the setts with Azospirillum. Mix 10 packets (2 kg) of Azospirillum in 100 litres of water and soak the setts for 30 minutes before planting.
    *   **Planting:** Place the setts in the furrows continuously with buds facing sideways, cover the setts with 5 cm of soil and irrigate immediately after planting.
    *   **Earthing up:** Partial earthing up on 45th day, second earthing up on 75th day and final earthing up on 90th day.
    *   **Detrashing:** On 120th and 180th day.
    *   **Trash Twist Propping:** On 180th day.
    *   **Harvest:** After 11 months.
*   **Improved Technologies**
    *   **Foliar Spray:** Foliar spray of TNAU Sugarcane Booster @ 1.0, 1.5 and 2 kg/acre in 200 litres of water at 45, 60 and 75 days after planting enhances cane growth and weight, internodal length, cane yield, sugar content and offers drought tolerance.
*   **Fertilizer Management**
    *   **General Recommendation:** 275 kg N, 62.5 kg P2O5 and 112.5 kg K2O / ha
    *   **Application Schedule:** Basal: Apply 75 kg N, 62.5 kg P2O5 and 112.5 kg K2O/ha in the furrows before planting, Top Dressing: Apply 100 kg N/ha on 45th day and 100 kg N/ha on 90th day.
    *   **Biofertilizers:** Soil application of Azospirillum @ 10 packets (2.0 kg/ha) after mixing with 25 kg of FYM + 25 kg of soil may be carried out before sowing/planting.
    *   **Micronutrients:** 12.5 kg /ha of MN mixture
*   **Water Management**
    *   Irrigate immediately after planting and ensure adequate moisture during the formative phase (30-90 days).
    *   Irrigation interval: 7 to 10 days depending on soil type and weather conditions.
    *   Waterlogged conditions should be avoided.
*   **Pre-Harvest Practices**
    *   **Detrashing:** Removal of dry leaves to improve aeration and reduce pest and disease incidence.
